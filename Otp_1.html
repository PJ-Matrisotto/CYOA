    <div id="scene-1">
    <p> A tiny library sits in front of you, filled to the brim with bookselfs and ordaments above the fireplace; with a old timey record-player in the corner next to the 
        fireplace; across from it sits various chairs. You try to remember how you got there, and
        your memories before you appeared into the room but its all a blank; Except for one thing: a voice that said <strong id="Unknown">"This is your punishment
         for all eterinty, have fun paying for your sins in life"</strong> with a meniacel laugh folowed
          by a fit of raspy coughs.
           As you look around your surroundings
            you see 2 books laying on the small table next
             to the red leather chair; 
             titles reading "The Illiad" by Homer & 
             "20,000 Leagues under the Sea" by Jules Verne; a crackle roars from
              the record-player <strong id="rp">"Hello there! Welcome to Eternal Punishment! 
                My Name is Bob;
                 And I will be your personal damion in this punishment;
                  lets seeeee here... Ah Yes; Reginald Simpson! 
                  Your punishment goes like this: Choose one of the books off the table
                   and attempt to make your way to the King of this relm and you will be set free,
                    Death will reset you here with no memory of what happends inside the runs. 
                    Seems simple enough right? Well I wish you luck sir; Enjoy your Eternal Punishment!"</strong></p></div>
